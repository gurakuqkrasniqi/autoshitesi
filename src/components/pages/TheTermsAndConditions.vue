              <li>
                No joint venture, partnership or agency or employment
                relationship has arisen by reason of these Terms.
              </li>
              <li>
                These Terms and any document expressly referred to in it
                constitutes the entire agreement between us regarding their
                subject matter, and supersedes and extinguishes all previous
                agreements, promises, assurances, warranties, representations
                and understandings between us, whether written or oral, relating
                to that subject matter. You agree that you shall have no
                remedies in respect of any statement, representation, assurance
                or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not
                set out in these Terms, or any document expressly referred to in
                it. You agree that you shall have no claim for innocent or
                negligent misrepresentation or negligent misstatement based on
                any statement in these Terms or any document expressly referred
                to in it.
              </li>
              <li>
                If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations
                under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against
                you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have
                waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not
                have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default
                by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean
                that we will automatically waive any later default by you.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each of the conditions of these Terms operates separately. If
                any court or competent authority decides that any of them are
                unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain
                in full force and effect.
              </li>
              <li>
                These Terms, its subject matter and its formation, and any other
                disputes or claims in connection therewith, are governed by
                Turkish law. In the event of any such disputes or claims in
                connection with these Terms, you agree to first engage in good
                faith discussions with us to resolve such dispute or claim. If
                such dispute or claim is not resolved within sixty (60) days, we
                both irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
                courts of Turkey.
